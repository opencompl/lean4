# Validation of `Repr Empty` instance

While it may seem unnecessary to have Repr, it prevents the automatic derivation
of Repr for other types when `Empty` is used as a type parameter.

This is a simplified version of an example from the "Functional Programming in Lean" book.
The Empty type is used to exclude the `other` constructor from the `Prim` type.
