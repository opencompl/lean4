Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the stylistic conventions of
the project and the specific part of the library you are planning to contribute
to. While the Lean compiler may not enforce strict formatting rules,
consistently formatted code is much easier for others to read and maintain.
Attention to formatting is more than a cosmetic concernâ€”it reflects the same
level of precision and care required to meet the deeper standards of the Lean 4
standard library.

A full style guide and naming convention are currently under construction and
will be added here soon.
