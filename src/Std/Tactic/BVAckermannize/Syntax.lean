/--
Close fixed-width `BitVec`, `Bool`, and uninterpreted function goals by obtaining a proof from an external SAT solver and
verifying it inside Lean. The solvable goals are currently limited to the Lean equivalent of
[`QF_BV`](https://smt-lib.org/logics-all.shtml#QF_BV) + [`QF_UF`](https://smt-lib.org/logics-all.shtml#QF_UF)

```lean
example : âˆ€ (a b : BitVec 64), (a &&& b) + (a ^^^ b) = a ||| b := by
