This directory contains the lemmas used for the normalizing simp set of `bv_decide`.
They are a combination of:
- rules that turn hypotheses involving `BitVec` and `Bool` into something of the form `x = true`
  where `x` only consists of `BitVec` and `Bool` terms, notably no `Prop`. This makes it easy to
  reflect the terms.
- rewrite rules used by Bitwuzla.
